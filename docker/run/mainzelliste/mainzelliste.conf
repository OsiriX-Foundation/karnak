# Template properties for mainzelliste
#
# The configuration listed here provides default values which should be suitable for
# a variety of szenarios. At least, the sections "Database setup" and "xDAT servers"
# should be adjusted to the local environment.

# General format: Key-value pairs, separated by spaces, tabs, "=", ":". 
# Lines starting with "#" are comments. Comments appended to a line are not possible!
# See Javadoc for java.util.Properties#load(Reader) for details.

# Property names may contain letters, numbers, underscores and dots. Dots define a hierarchical
# structure on the property names.

# Leading and trailing whitespaces in property values are not allowed and will be removed
# after loading.

# For a comprehensive documentation of configuration parameters see the configuration manual
# ("Konfigurationshandbuch").

# debug mode: If set to true, token handling is disabled (i.e. no tokens are necessary).
debug = false

# Uncomment this for MySQL

# Field definitions
#
# Every input field must be defined here with field.{fieldname}.type = {fieldtype},
# where fieldname is a unique identifier and fieldtype the name of a subclass of Field.
# Input data from the field will be stored in objects of that class.
#
# Every field defined here must either be contained in the input form 
# WEB-INF/jsp/patientFormElements.jsp (with corresponding "name"-Tag) or
# be provided in the createPatient Token

# In order to deactivate fields temporarily, it is sufficient to comment out the field definition.

# Exchange groups   
#
# An exchange group denotes a set of fields whose values are considered interchangeable.
# The matcher (currently only EpilinkMatcher) compares the fields in each exchange group to
# all of its permutations and uses the best matching combination for final decision.
#
# An exchange group is defined by exchangeGroup.{id} = {fieldlist}, where id is a sequential number
# and fieldlist a comma-separated list of field names
#exchangeGroup.0 = name, lastname, secondname





# Field transformations
#
# Transformations for a field {fieldname} are defined by
# field.{fieldname}.transformers = {transformerlist}, where
# transformerlist is a comma-separated list of names of subclasses of FieldTransformer.
# 
# The first transformer in the list is applied to the input field as defined in the field definition;
# i.e. the type parameter IN of the first transformer must match the class of the field.
# Every subsequent transformer is applied to the output of its predecessor; i.e. its type parameter IN
# must match type parameter OUT of the preceding transformer.

# matcher.epilink.{fieldname}.frequency: Defines the assumed mean frequency of values

# matcher.epilink.threshold_non_match: Defines the weight (in the interval [0,1])
# below which a pair of records is considered a definite non-match. Must be less than or equal
